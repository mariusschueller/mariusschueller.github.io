# Description

Microfluidic (uFluidic) devices refer to systems with small liquid channels. Microfluidic devices can be used in fluid mixing, droplet generation, and fluid separation. There are many possible applications including medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, tissue engineering, and
environmental testing. By leveraging precise control over small volumes of liquids, microfluidic devices enable efficient and accurate processes, revolutionizing traditional methods and opening avenues for rapid, cost-effective, and portable solutions in a multitude of applications.

In microfluidics, achieving effective mixing poses a significant challenge due to the absence of turbulent mixing commonly observed in macro-scale fluid systems. Instead, microfluidic devices typically operate under laminar flow conditions within small chambers, where conventional mixing mechanisms are inefficient. To overcome this limitation, the next solution is chaotic advection, which leverages geometric intricacies or external perturbations to induce chaotic flow patterns within the laminar regime, thereby enhancing mixing efficiency. This necessitates innovative design approaches and precise control strategies to harness chaotic advection for homogeneous mixing.
