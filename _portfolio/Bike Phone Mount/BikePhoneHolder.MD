# Top-down Modeling and its Use
Top-down modeling is the process where new components are modeled around the assembly. This allows for a design process where new parts are created based on previously designed parts. In this project, I began my design by creating the bar. From there I modeled the clamp onto the bar. I continued by adding the main phone holder with the screw. I then used the screw to model the top phone holder and the fastener.

# Design Rational
The rationale behind my design was one where ideally any phone of any size could fit. As a result, I focused on high adjustability. My solution to doing this was to use a 3D printed long screw section. Essentially, two parts will clamp onto the phone. One part is detached and can move through a gap in the screw while the other is stationary. The moving section will have a fastener that can tighten behind it, clamping down on the phone. By doing this, both horizontal and vertical phone orientations can be used.

# Assembly instructions 
Use M5 screws and fasteners to attach the bar clamp to the phone holder part. From there, use M5 screws to clamp the part around the bar. The screws should be tightened until firmly set on the bar. Now the phone can be placed. Attach the moving phone holder part and then the fastener onto the screw. The phone holder part can freely move to the phone, so now rotate the fastener until tight on the phone.

# Material choice 
I used PLA entirely for this project. The main reason behind this was to simplify the design process. PLA is the simplest and strongest material that can easily be printed, which is why I used it. While using TPU for gripping would work great, not using multimaterial parts allowed me to quickly design and test my prints.
