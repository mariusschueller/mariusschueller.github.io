# Description

This project involves creating a cost-effective syringe pump as a substitute for commercial models. Utilizing CAD, electrical prototyping, programming, and 3D printing, the design aims to be affordable yet highly effective for dispensing precise liquid amounts. Key features include a stepper motor for control, compatibility with different syringe diameters, an LED indicating pump status, and a safety limit switch. The model is enclosed for protection, designed for easy disassembly, and incorporates unique branding. The programming, done through Arduino, ensures dynamic control of the pump with safety measures and visual feedback.

# Operating Instructions

1. **Loading the Syringe:**
   - Place the syringe in the pump with its outward extrusions fitting into the middle support.
   - Ensure the syringe tip faces away from the motor, and the plunger end is in the carriage's top extrusion.

2. **Powering On:**
   - Plug in the syringe pump to an outlet. 

3. **Starting Operation:**
   - Once powered on, press the latching button to start the pump. The LED will turn green, indicating the pump is running.

4. **Pausing Operation:**
   - Press the latching button once more to pause the pump. The LED will turn yellow, signaling a pause in operation.

5. **Completing Operation:**
   - When the syringe is empty, and the carriage hits the limit switch on the middle mount, the pump stops, and the LED turns red.

6. **Directional Control:**
   - Use additional buttons to change the motor's direction.
   - Hold the left button to move the syringe back for refilling, and hold the right button to empty the syringe at a constant rate.
